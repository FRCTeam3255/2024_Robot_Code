## What is CRESCENDO?
![FRC_SocialDLC_FB_Post](src\main\assets\FRC_SocialDLC_FB_Post.png)

CRESCENDO, presented by Haas, is the 2024 Season of the FIRST Robotics Competition. Each season has its unique objectives and limitations. 
Students have 6 weeks to construct a robot to compete in the season. Once the 6 weeks are up, teams compete at regional or district-level 
competitions (depending on region) to qualify for the FIRST Championship in Houston, Texas.
