AUTO NAMING CONVENTIONS

First Letter indicates the category of auto.
The AMP is at the top of the field and the BLUE alliance is on the left.

D - Down
U - Up
W - Wing

The rest of the auto indicates the game pieces it collects, and if it scores them. See AutoDiagram.png for more information.
EX:
PsW1sC2a = Preload scores in speaker, we intake Wing Note 1 and score it in the speaker, we intake Centerline Note 2 and score it in the Amp.

"Until" indicates that the process repeats for all game pieces on the way to that piece. 
This is because the path in Choreo is actually one large path that we split up into .traj files when exporting.
It is highly reccommended to view the path in Choreo using ChoreoPaths.chor before usage so you understand them. 

Usage:

You want an auto to go up from C2 to C3, score C3, then go to C4.
GO FROM C2 TO C3: U C1UntilC5.2.traj
SCORE C3 THEN GO TO C4: U C1sUntilC5s.3
